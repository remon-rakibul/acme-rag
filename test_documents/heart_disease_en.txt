Heart Disease Prevention and Management

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Understanding risk factors and implementing preventive measures can significantly reduce the likelihood of developing cardiovascular problems.

Primary Risk Factors:
1. High Blood Pressure: Hypertension increases the workload on your heart. Maintain blood pressure below 120/80 mmHg through lifestyle changes and medication if needed.

2. High Cholesterol: Elevated LDL (bad) cholesterol can lead to plaque buildup in arteries. Aim for LDL below 100 mg/dL and HDL (good) cholesterol above 40 mg/dL for men and 50 mg/dL for women.

3. Smoking: Tobacco use damages blood vessels and increases heart disease risk. Quitting smoking is one of the most important steps you can take.

4. Diabetes: Poorly controlled diabetes significantly increases cardiovascular risk. Maintain A1C levels below 7% and manage blood glucose effectively.

5. Obesity and Sedentary Lifestyle: Excess weight and lack of physical activity strain the heart. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise weekly.

Prevention Strategies:
- Follow a heart-healthy diet (Mediterranean or DASH diet)
- Maintain a healthy weight (BMI 18.5-24.9)
- Limit alcohol consumption (moderation is key)
- Manage stress through relaxation techniques
- Get adequate sleep (7-9 hours per night)
- Regular health screenings and check-ups

Warning Signs of Heart Attack:
- Chest pain or discomfort
- Shortness of breath
- Nausea or lightheadedness
- Pain in arms, neck, jaw, or back
- Cold sweat

If you experience these symptoms, seek immediate medical attention. Early intervention saves lives.

Remember: Prevention is always better than cure. Small lifestyle changes can make a significant difference in your heart health.
