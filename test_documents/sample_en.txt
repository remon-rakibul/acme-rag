Diabetes Management Guidelines

Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition that affects how your body processes blood sugar (glucose). Proper management is essential for maintaining good health and preventing complications.

Key Management Strategies:
1. Blood Glucose Monitoring: Regular monitoring helps track your blood sugar levels throughout the day. Aim for fasting glucose between 80-130 mg/dL and post-meal glucose below 180 mg/dL.

2. Medication Adherence: Take prescribed medications as directed by your healthcare provider. Common medications include metformin, insulin, and other oral medications.

3. Healthy Diet: Follow a balanced diet rich in vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Limit refined sugars and processed foods. Consider working with a registered dietitian.

4. Regular Exercise: Engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week. Activities like walking, swimming, and cycling are excellent choices.

5. Regular Medical Check-ups: Schedule regular appointments with your healthcare team to monitor your condition, including A1C tests (aim for below 7%), blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.

6. Foot Care: Inspect your feet daily for cuts, blisters, or sores. Maintain good foot hygiene and wear appropriate footwear.

7. Stress Management: High stress levels can affect blood glucose. Practice relaxation techniques, meditation, or seek support when needed.

Emergency Situations:
- Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar): Symptoms include shakiness, confusion, sweating. Treat with glucose tablets or sugary drinks.
- Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar): Symptoms include frequent urination, excessive thirst. Contact your healthcare provider if levels are consistently high.

Remember: Diabetes management is a lifelong journey. Work closely with your healthcare team to develop a personalized treatment plan that works for you.
